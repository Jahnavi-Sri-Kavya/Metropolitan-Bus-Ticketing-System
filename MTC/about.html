2nd year Software engineering Students pursuing their degree at VIT Chennai. The main 
aim of this web portal was to maintain Social distancing and to avoid contact with 
the conductor and other passengers in the bus, as it promotes the spread of Corona virus.
The idea of this web portal was proposed in December 2019 and was implemented in June 2020 amidst
the COVID-19 pandemic and has earned huge applauds from the Public.</font>
